# List of Design Patterns
### https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns

## Creational
Creational patterns are ones that create objects for you, rather than having you instantiate objects directly. This gives your program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given case.

### Abstract factory pattern
groups object factories that have a common theme.
### Builder pattern
constructs complex objects by separating construction and representation.
### Factory method pattern
creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
### Prototype pattern
creates objects by cloning an existing object.
### Singleton pattern
restricts object creation for a class to only one instance.
